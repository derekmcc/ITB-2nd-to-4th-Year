englishFootball,"Manchester United are making memories under Solskjaer and that matters. Nobody will ever forget the events in Paris whatever happens against Barcelona next month. But as Solskjaer is fond of pointing out, United are a club that wins trophies, so the FA Cup was the obvious prize to underline the dramatic turnaround under his leadership. Instead, United served up what Solskjaer himself described as their poorest performance of his reign. The 2-0 defeat to Arsenal in the Premier League might have been disappointing but it was not entirely deserved. Romelu Lukaku had the better chances. The 2-1 defeat at Wolves in the FA Cup quarter-final was different. It was, as he admitted, a backward step. ""We never had the urgency or the quality on the ball,"" said Solskjaer. ""The tempo wasn't high enough so we played into their hands really. I think we felt too comfortable in possession. We never managed to put their goalkeeper under pressure."" Indeed, Marcus Rashford's consolation goal in stoppage time was United's second shot on target all game. Solskjaer has succeeded in restoring United's counter-attack but on the night that he also restored Paul Pogba's captain's armband, his players produced a performance that harked back to the days of his predecessor. United dominated the ball but everything was too slow and they lacked the imagination to break down an organised defence. In the press conference afterwards, it was difficult to fault Solskjaer. He was generous in his appraisal of the opposition and disarmingly frank about the efforts of his own team without throwing his players under the bus. He had said what needed to be said, he explained, but would not be sharing that with the media. Then came the rallying call for the fans. ""We are ready to go again after the internationals,"" he continued. ""We have so much to play for. We cannot wait for the challenge for third and, of course, big nights like when Barcelona come. There are so many highlights to look forward to. Don't worry about the players' attitude because when we come back again we will give it a good go."" Solskjaer has certainly done that but how he could have done with continuing this FA Cup run. Having seen off Arsenal and Chelsea only Wolves stood in the way of a trip to Wembley - and they now play Watford for a place in the final. Whisper it but this might also have been United's best chance of denying Manchester City their unprecedented quadruple. It was about more than stopping others though. Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho know from experience that it takes more than a trophy or three to keep this job, but Solskjaer is the one who has embraced that tradition. ""April and May at Manchester United we narrow the focus and it's now about winning trophies,"" he said on the eve of the Wolves game. There was a tweak to the statement after the defeat with the reference to winning trophies removed but the sentiment staying the same. ""Manchester United in April and May always find our form,"" he said in one of his now customary references to the club's glory days. But United need to beat Barcelona if they are to progress to the last four of the Champions League. That is now their only shot at silverware this season and it is a long one. It's a pity because while the FA Cup did not save Van Gaal it might have been the making of Solskjaer. The critics of Mauricio Pochettino, the one time favourite to become United's next boss before the caretaker started racking up the wins, like to point to the absence of trophies on the Tottenham's coach's resume as evidence that he is not the right man for the job. In fact, it was Pochettino's comment about them in January that offered Solskjaer the perfect opportunity to position himself as a contrast to his prospective rival. After the Argentine implied that domestic cups were merely about ego, Solskjaer soon said: ""We can't just say top four and that's it. We've got to look whether we can win something this year."" Given that the odds of that now stand at 16/1 with most bookmakers, it seems the answer to that question is likely to be no. If so, his suitability to take Manchester United forwards next season and beyond will be assessed in a more sober climate than the euphoria that greeted the team's unexpected and exhilarating triumph against Paris Saint-Germain. A defeat or two can lend that perspective. It can lead to more forensic analysis. It might even spark renewed debate about the difference between the man who can correct course and the individual best placed to plot a new path; between the coach who can get his team playing when free of expectation and the one who can convince them to embrace it. They are key questions, ones worth asking even if the answer still turns out to be that extending Solskjaer's reign is simply the right thing to do. But questions that could not have been asked had he been able to add some more FA Cup magic to go with the European exploits. For that reason, the competition can only be seen as an opportunity missed."
englishFootball,"City remain in the hunt for the quadruple this season but slipped back down to second in the Premier League table following Liverpool's 2-1 win at Fulham on Super Sunday. Only a handful of senior players will remain in Manchester during the last international break of the season and Guardiola hopes he will not have to contend with any fresh injury concerns when the others return. ""I pray, pray, that they come back fit,"" Guardiola told City's website. ""They have to go to their national teams, they have to go, enjoy and play for their country, but I hope they can come back fit like they are now. ""Maybe they will go away, score three goals and return with the same rhythm, who knows? I just want them fit and here. ""Sergio, David Silva, Aymeric Laporte and a few others will have a week's rest. They will have a training programme to do a little bit each day and then a week of normal training ahead of the Fulham game."" City could face as many as eight games in April but Guardiola is confident his side have the physical and mental strength to maintain their challenge on all fronts. ""With the fixtures we have in April, we need everybody - it's crazy,"" he said. ""Everybody is going to play and Kevin (De Bruyne), Ferna (Fernandinho), John (Stones), Benjamin (Mendy)... they are all going to be back soon, and we need them. ""Everybody has contributed, and it has been massive. We are demanding more and more, and we have to train hard and then play well as possible again and again and again. ""Believe me, to get to the international break and go into April with only a month and a half to go and still be there is incredible, and it is an honour for me. ""To have this spirit, desire, this intensity and overcome difficult situations - I told the players that this is going to happen quite often between now and the end of the season where the mentality will be the difference."""
englishFootball,"Second-half goals from Raul Jimenez and Diogo Jota saw Wolves go through to the semi-finals with Marcus Rashford's stoppage-time goal not enough to save United at Molineux. It means after a run of nine away wins in a row, Solskjaer has seen his side lose back-to-back games against Arsenal and Wolves. ""It was a big step backwards I have got to say,"" said Solskjaer. ""That was the poorest performance since I got here. ""Last week we were happy with the performance but today we never had the urgency or the quality on the ball. ""Without the ball we did OK first half but the tempo on the ball wasn't high enough so we played into their hands really. ""I think we felt too comfortable in possession. We never managed to put their goalkeeper under pressure. ""We know we played well against Arsenal last week and didn't get what we deserved. This week we did get what we deserved because we never deserved to win this game."" With United still chasing a place in the Premier League's top four and having a Champions League quarter-final against Barcelona to look forward to, Solskjaer is not too downbeat. ""Of course, you can't sit down and sulk too long,"" he added. ""Of course we are disappointed, everyone is disappointed with the result today. ""But we are ready to go again after the internationals. We have so much to play for. Manchester United in April and May always find our form. ""We cannot wait for the challenge for third and, of course, big nights like when Barcelona come. There are so many highlights to look forward to. ""Don't worry about the players' attitude because when we come back again we will give it a good go."""
englishFootball,"The Scot was appointed as United manager following the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson, but lasted just 10 months in the job before being sacked with the club eventually slumping to a seventh-place finish. Reflecting on his short spell at Old Trafford, Moyes revealed the lengths United went to in a bid to sign Bale, who went on to join Madrid from Tottenham for a then-world-record Â£85m fee. ""By the time we got to the end of the transfer window, we always thought we had a chance of getting Gareth Bale,"" Moyes told beIN SPORTS. ""We hoped we could talk him out of going to Real Madrid because it was already half done. ""We had offered more money, we tried to entice him. We did [have a helicopter ready] and we tried."" Bale has won four Champions League titles and one La Liga crown during his six seasons at the Santiago Bernabeu, scoring 102 goals in 224 appearances."
englishFootball,"Chelsea are facing a transfer ban for the next two windows and could lose Hazard in the summer, with his contract set to expire in 2020. Maurizio Sarri's side lost 2-0 at Everton on Super Sunday, and now sit three points off the top four with eight games of the Premier League season remaining. Chelsea have won 15 trophies since Roman Abramovich bought the club in 2003, but they face a battle to reach the Champions League next season, and Souness also believes the club's trophy-winning days may be numbered. ""If you are Hazard, you are one of the best players in the world, and you are thinking I'm now arguably at the peak of my career and I want to be winning the big trophies. Will that happen at Chelsea? I don't think so. They look like they will struggle to get into the top four. Chelsea have a big decision to make, do they cash in or let him walk in 15 months?"" Souness added: ""It's difficult times ahead for Chelsea. I think there's a big sea change in how they see things going forward. I don't think they will be winning trophies in the immediate future."" Former Liverpool and Tottenham midfielder Jamie Redknapp agreed with Souness that Chelsea, and Hazard, face an uncertain future. Redknapp said: ""Hazard is the key. He went to Chelsea for the Champions League but if they don't get in it this year then it gives him an excuse to leave. He seems incredibly loyal and obviously loves the club, but he has a real predicament if they don't get into the Champions League, and so do the club, because it's an opportunity to cash in, but you can't buy anybody to replace him. ""When they won titles they had Didier Drogba, one of the great centre-forwards, and they had Diego Costa. I don't think they have that person now. I think the fans have to be patient. ""They have to try to keep hold of Hazard but if they can't I want to see the players like Callum Hudson-Odoi given a chance. The fans want to see young players get a chance."" Souness also declared himself ""dismayed"" by Chelsea's performance at Everton, saying they play like a ""five-a-side team"". Chelsea dominated the first half at Goodison Park but failed to break the deadlock. They then conceded twice after half-time as their Premier League top-four hopes suffered a setback. ""Chelsea dismay me,"" said Souness. ""They must be wonderful at five-a-side, but look at the stats. They have two thirds of possession, dominated things, had twice as many touches, and they lose 2-0. If you are having that much of the ball where are you having it? It's on the halfway line and in your own half. That's how they are playing, they're like a five-a-side team. ""You take Eden Hazard out of the equation and where's the threat coming from? They have a midfield that is made up of (N'Golo) Kante, who is a fabulous player but doesn't really get goals, and Jorginho, who has two goals this season, and (Ross) Barkley. They don't get goals. The mix is totally wrong. ""If you insist on playing Jorginho, who is neat and tidy but not a goal threat, you have to have goal threats on either side of him. You can't rely on Hazard to do it week in, week out, it's too much for him. You have to share the goals around. ""It's not just about today, this is Chelsea. That's why they look like finishing outside the top four."""
englishFootball,"The pitch invasions occurred at Premier League fixtures at West Ham and Bournemouth, and an FA Cup tie at Swansea. Seven Newcastle fans were arrested at the Vitality Stadium for entering the playing area to celebrate Matt Ritchie's late goal which earned the visitors a 2-2 draw on Saturday afternoon. Dorset Police confirmed on Monday that five fans have been charged and are due to appear at Poole Magistrates' Court on April 2. Meanwhile, a man has been charged and two teenagers cautioned by South Wales Police after going onto the pitch during Swansea's 3-2 FA Cup loss to Manchester City, and a West Ham fan ran onto the pitch at the London Stadium during their win over Huddersfield. The FA are waiting for the referees' match reports before seeking observations from the clubs. Paul Mitchell, 27, of Rubery, was recently jailed for 14 weeks and given a 10-year banning order from all stadiums for running onto the pitch and attacking Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish in a derby game at Birmingham."
englishFootball,"Chelsea dominated the first half at Goodison Park and did everything but score, registering 10 attempts on goal, including an Eden Hazard effort which stuck the post. Everton dent Chelsea top-four hopesEverton 2-0 Chelsea: As it happened But Everton overpowered them in the second half in every department as goals from Richarlison and Gylfi Sigurdsson secured a 2-0 victory. ""It's not impossible,"" said Sarri, when asked if Chelsea's top-four challenge was finished. ""Why impossible?"" ""We need to recover only three points so it's not impossible in eight matches. It's impossible if we are not able to improve, if we are not able to avoid a second half like that. ""We played probably the best 45 minutes of the season and then suddenly at the beginning of the second half we stopped playing - I don't know why,"" Sarri added. ""We were in trouble. ""The situation was clear, it's clear the problem is not a physical problem, if it was physical you would go down gradually, not in one second. It's probably a mental block. Pressed to give his reasons for Chelsea's latest abject away performance, Sarri told Sky Sports: ""I don't know, and the players don't know what happened in the second half. I cannot explain it. ""We played the best first half in the season and we could have scored four or five and then suddenly we stopped playing. It's very strange and we stopped to defend and counter-attack. ""We were in control of the match and we played very well so we needed continue but we didn't defend at the start of the second half. We changed the system, but it was the same. ""The problem was mental on the pitch, so the system and the tactics are not important. It wasn't about motivation because we started very well. We have to play eight matches now and we have to fight for our possibilities."""
englishFootball,"Mane produced another piece of brilliance for Liverpool's opening goal against Fulham. ""I love what he does,"" Jamie Redknapp told Sky Sports. ""He is not just content to pass the ball and stand still, he wants to pass it and get into the box with a bit of pace. ""That's just a man who is red hot right now."" It was the timing of Mane's run that was the key factor in that goal but it's the timing of the forward's run of form that has been absolutely crucial to maintaining Liverpool's title push. They are back at the top of the Premier League and that could not have happened without him. Mohamed Salah's goals had propelled Jurgen Klopp's team to another level for much of the past 18 months. Unfortunately, the Egyptian has endured a dip in form and has now gone seven games without a goal - by far the worst sequence of his Liverpool career. It appears to be affecting Salah's decision-making now, but it has not affected his team too badly - and that is down to Mane. He has seven goals in his last five games, 11 in his last 11. He now has 20 goals in all competitions and this is the best league return of his career too. ""This is not just the form man in the Premier League, this is the form man in Europe,"" said Jamie Carragher on co-commentary for Sky Sports and the numbers back that up. He has nine Premier League goals in 2019, which is a tally that only Sergio Aguero can match. ""That's no penalties as well,"" added Carragher. ""If you think of the top scorers in this league, Salah, Harry Kane and Aguero are taking penalties and he's right up there alongside them."" Indeed, strip out the penalty goals by those other players and Mane has now outscored every other player in the Premier League this season. It is tempting to think that the opportunities are now falling to Mane instead of Salah and some of Klopp's recent comments seem to suggest that it is just one of those things. ""With goalscoring, always a little bit of luck is involved and if you have it in a moment like this then you have to use it because there will be other moments in life,"" said the Liverpool manager. ""He always had the quality. He's just in a good moment of his career."" Some of the numbers support this argument. Mane has got himself into good positions but he has still scored more goals than might have been expected from the chances that he has had. According to Opta, Mane has had 18 clear-cut chances to score in the Premier League this season, which is fewer than the other top scorers in the competition. In fact, it's the same number as Manchester City's Gabriel Jesus but Mane has converted 11 of his opportunities and Jesus only four. But Mane's increased output also reflects his growing maturity. He turns 27 next month and his first goal against Bayern Munich on Wednesday was that of a man who appears ready to seize the moment. He has a manager who believes in him and supporters who adore him. ""Sadio is coming to an age where things are becoming more natural for him,"" said Klopp. ""He is not in the part where he has to convince everybody every day of his career, that he has a good one. We all know he is a world-class player and now he starts realising that himself."" Klopp added: ""Mixed up with his attitude and his work-rate, it could be a really decent career, even better than it has been so far."" The prospect of Mane making further progress is an exciting one for Liverpool supporters. But the truth is that they need him at his best right now. It's Tottenham next up at Anfield and if Liverpool can negotiate that then belief will only grow that they can keep up the pressure on Manchester City right to the end. After that, there's the trip to Mane's former club Southampton. In truth, every single game matters. Liverpool cannot do it without Salah ending his goal drought, most supporters will accept that. But they have a chance thanks to the efforts of Mane. ""What a signing he has been for Liverpool,"" said Carragher. And what an iconic signing he could yet go on to become."
englishFootball,"It was confirmed on Sunday Spurs' first game in their new ground will be against Crystal Palace on Wednesday, April 3 - seven months after they were due to move in. However, at a meeting with the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust on Tuesday, Levy said ""with a debt of Â£637m, subject to reasonable assumption on interest rates, the net spend on players would not be affected"". But the chairman did concede qualifying for the Champions League would give Spurs - who are currently three points above fifth-placed Manchester United - ""more flexibility"" in the market. Levy was also asked by the club's supporters why they have not signed a player in the last two transfer windows. Levy said striking deals had been ""tricky"" and he was disappointed the market ""wasn't as liquid as it had been previously"". The 51-year-old, who has been in his post since 2001, refused to reveal the final cost of building the new stadium as ""further works are still to be undertaken"". He said spending would continue for another 12 months. Levy also told fans the opening ceremony for the new stadium may not take place before the first match against Palace, as the fixture is in the evening during midweek, and fans may already have to rush from work to make the game. Furthermore, Levy announced naming rights for the stadium are not yet in place and that, contrary to reports in the media, Spurs have never been in talks with Nike over such a deal. Away from the new stadium, he declared to the supporters the club will be undertaking a full review into their women's team, who are currently top of the Women's Championship."
englishFootball,"The news comes as a result of Brighton beating Millwall in the FA Cup quarter-finals on Sunday. Spurs were due to play Brighton in the first match at the new ground on either April 6 or 7, but Chris Hughton's team will play Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-finals that weekend. Spurs say ticketing and event details for the match against Crystal Palace will be announced on Monday. While the first match at the new stadium has now been arranged, Spurs still need to obtain a safety certificate before they can host games. To do so, they must successfully host two test events at the new ground. The first will be the Tottenham vs Southampton U18 match on Sunday, March 24, with the second being a Tottenham Legends game six days later. Spurs were originally supposed to move into the new 62,062 capacity stadium in September 2018, but various delays have pushed the move back several months."
englishFootball,"Valencia, 33, is out of contract at Old Trafford at the end of the season and his father, Luis, says the player will definitely leave the club in the summer. He claims Arsenal, along with West Ham, Inter Milan and a club in China, are interested in signing the Ecuadorian full-back. Luis Valencia told Ecuadorian newspaper El Universo: ""He definitely will not continue in Manchester. ""He wants a change in the air and the club is not going to renew him either. Like everything in life, everything comes to an end."" When asked about Valencia's next move, he responded: ""Arsenal, West Ham, Inter Milan and one club from China are options, but in football everything is changing. ""He wants to choose the best option, but above all he wants to sign a contract for two years. ""Not for the money, but for peace and hopefully, he told me, be hired by a team that fights for important things."" Arsenal's first-choice right-back Hector Bellerin has been sidelined with a serious knee injury since January and is not expected back until the start of next season. The Gunners also signed 35-year-old right-back Stephan Lichtsteiner on a free transfer last summer on a one-year deal."
englishFootball,"This weekend's 2-1 FA Cup quarter-final defeat at Wolves followed a 2-0 loss at Arsenal last week to leave United's season in danger of derailing. Fifth-placed United are currently just a point ahead of Chelsea and two points adrift of Arsenal with just eight league games left to play. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side also have a two-legged Champions League quarter-final against Barcelona to face next month. ""We have to give our best now to reach the top four,"" said Nemanja Matic in the wake of the Molineux defeat. ""We cannot let it go like this, we will analyse everything as there is still a lot to play for. ""We have eight games to play in the Premier League and we are fighting for the top four. ""We have the Champions League as well. We will see what we are able to do and how much quality we have. ""Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham will also give their best to be in the top four. Everybody knows that."" After the defeat Solskjaer claimed it was the worst performance of his reign but the Serbia midfielder expects the boss to put it right. He said: ""I am sure he (Solskjaer) will turn this situation around and we will do better. ""After the international break we will see. The first game back after a break is always difficult especially for a team who has so many players away in the national teams. Almost everybody at United is on duty. ""We spoke after the game and said we have to be focused for the next one and stick together and get the top four which is the main target for us."""
englishFootball,"It was a brilliant display from Nuno Espirito Santo's team, who stepped up their intensity in the second half with Raul Jimenez (70) and Diogo Jota (76) grabbing the all-important goals. Marcus Rashford scored (90+5) what was barely a consolation for a lacklustre United, who have now suffered two straight defeats under Ole Gunnar Solksjear. VAR was in use and overturned a red card to Victor Lindelof (80) after a crunching tackle on Jota by the touchline. Wolves: Ruddy (7), Coady (8), Boly (8), Jonny (8), Doherty (8), Neves (7), Dendoncker (7), Saiss (8), Moutinho (8), Jota (8), Jimenez (8)Subs: Traore (N/A), Costa (N/A)Man Utd: Romero (8), Dalot (6), Lindelof (5), Smalling (6), Shaw (6), Herrera (6), Matic (6), Pogba (5), Lingard (6), Rashford (6), Martial (4)Subs:  Pereira (6), Mata (N/A), McTominay (N/A)Man of the match: Raul Jimenez Wolves are now dreaming of winning their first silverware since 1980 with Watford, Manchester City and one of Millwall and Brighton awaiting them in the semi-finals. The visitors dominated possession in the early stages without hurting the hosts - a pattern which bore out during a dull opening 45 minutes. Wolves' best chance came three minutes before the break when Jota was played through by Ruben Neves but Sergio Romero - excellent throughout - made a fine block. Jimenez forced a spectacular one-handed save from Romero just after the break, the goalkeeper reacting quickly to tip the ball onto the crossbar. United were there for the taking and Wolves seized their opportunity with 20 minutes remaining. Joao Moutinho took three United players out with a piece of quality down the left and found Jimenez, who fired a low effort into the net after being afforded too much room. Six minutes later, the game was over when Jota outmuscled Luke Shaw on the counter attack and struck a low effort past Romero at his near post. United escaped further misery late on when Lindelof was initially dismissed for a foul on Jota. However, VAR was used to switch the defender's punishment to just a booking. Rashford did strike in injury time but it did not matter though - Wolves are going to Wembley. The Mexico international fired his third goal in as many games and led the line with great skill and authority, which set the platform for Wolves to strangle United in the second half. That's 15 goals for the season now for the striker as his status within the Wolves fan-base grows week-by-week. Due to the international break, both teams have a 14-day break. Wolves visit Burnley on March 30 while United host Watford on the same day."
englishFootball,"The 2-1 victory at Molineux thanks to goals by Raul Jimenez and Diogo Jota means Wolves are in the semi-finals for the first time in 21 years and are looking to win the trophy for the first time since 1960. ""It means a lot, of course,"" said Nuno. ""The FA Cup is the oldest competition there is. We played well and we achieved it with the amazing support of our fans pushing us. ""What pleases me more is that as I walk down the steps there are people telling me they saw the 50s and the 60s and they are still coming. ""To give them back this joy and see our fans going out of the stadium with a smile, with a lot of beer, of course, it feels good."" Marcus Rashford did pull a goal back for United in stoppage time but it was too late to trouble Wolves and the home side deserved their victory. ""I think in the first half we defended very well, very organised and very compact,"" added Nuno. ""We allowed them possession of the ball but tried to recover in the right areas. The shape worked very well. ""In the second half, I think we managed the ball better. We had possessions. We created problems for them with our movements. And then it's talent. Talent based on organisation."" Wolves are second favourites to win the FA Cup behind Premier League leaders Manchester City but Nuno is not looking too far ahead. ""We did what we have to do and now we prepare for the next one,"" he said."
englishFootball,"The Hornets are into the FA Cup semi-finals after a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace - with Gray scoring the winner 121 seconds after coming on - and two games away from winning the tournament for the first time in their history. Their only appearance in the final came back in 1984, when Graham Taylor's side were beaten by Everton at Wembley - but 35 years on, Gracia has the opportunity to write his own name into Watford history over the next two months. He said: ""We'll see what we are able to achieve in the future, I don't know if we will be able to play in the final but that's our target. We want to enjoy the semi-final, of course, but we want to be in the final and have the same mentality we have had all season. Be competitive, and game-by-game I think we will be able to achieve something this season."" Gray's goal enhanced the reputation all strikers dread - with another starring role as a super-sub to score from the bench for the third home game in a row. But Gracia spoke highly of his regular back-up striker after the game and added his hot streak had been no fluke. He said: ""He's done it in recent games too so it's not a surprise. He always has chances to score. His finishing has been very good, he's scored important goals for the team. ""It was a difficult decision because the game was open, and to take off Will [Hughes], put Gerard on the right and Andre up front with Troy was difficult, but it was good for the team."""
englishFootball,"The Hammers were staring at an embarrassing defeat to the Premier League's bottom side with 15 minutes left, before Angelo Ogbonna and a Javier Hernandez double handed them a memorable three points. Pellegrini was less than impressed with West Ham's first half performance and their defending from set-pieces, but he was delighted with the fight shown at the end and labelled it a win for the supporters. ""This is a match for the fans,"" Pellegrini said. ""Everyone was disappointed with our performance when we were losing 3-1. ""I think that the biggest merit for our team was that we never gave up, we tried to continue, we kept working, playing and we scored three goals."" On the first-half display, he added: ""We didn't play with the pace that this game needed. Before the game I talked with our players and we told them that this is a team that plays well, they are nearly relegated and have no pressure. ""Maybe they do not score too many goals but they are dangerous at set pieces and their first two goals came from set-pieces. ""We were a little bit lucky as there was as moment in our box when two of their players missed a chance, or it would have been 4-3 to them. So I think that bit of luck, and our reaction to going 3-1 down and the character of the team was important."" Pellegrini was also pleased that he was able to bring on quality players from the bench. Javier Hernandez was introduced at half-time and scored twice, while Samir Nasri's cross set up Hernandez's first. ""That's important for our team,"" Pellegrini said. ""We've played the whole season with eight or nine players injured, when you have a stronger bench it's so important."""
englishFootball,"The England centre-back was dismissed for a last-man foul on Johann Berg Gudmundsson but the Foxes were undeterred, as James Maddison's free-kick gave them the lead. Dwight McNeil levelled and Burnley pilled on the pressure but failed to genuinely test Kasper Schmeichel. Leicester then claimed the ultimate smash and grab when Wes Morgan, who came on for Demarai Gray after Maguire's dismissal, headed home from Youri Tielemans' deflected cross. The first away win of Rodgers' tenure in charge keeps Leicester in the race for seventh, which could be enough for a place in the Europa League. ""Everyone knows how tough it is to come here with 11 men but to play almost the whole game [with 10]. We actually started quite bright in that opening five minutes, but to lose a man and dig in like we did it was an incredible performance of resilience,"" said the Northern Irishman. ""You have to fight, you have to be resilient and you have to be persistent and when the chances come you've got to take them. A fantastic three points. ""You see the spirit in the team. The emotion that they show together and they were worth of it."" Morgan was named on the bench as Rodgers selected an unchanged side from the 3-1 win over Fulham last weekend. But the captain was soon required and Rodgers hailed the 35-year-old's performance at both ends. ""He's done it all of his career,"" the ex-Swansea City and Liverpool boss added. ""Defensively in the box he was incredible. ""Him and Jonny Evans were putting their head onto everything and they were certainly overworked in that period and throughout the game. ""But you always fancy it at 1-1 and we got a corner late on. They defend it well, it comes out and then Youri whips a great ball in and the big guys gets up and has done what he's done. A great header."" Rodgers had no argument with the sending off of Maguire, which will see him suspended for the visit of Bournemouth after the international break. Meanwhile, Maddison reacted to being omitted from Gareth Southgate's England squad for the start of Euro 2020 qualifying with a stunning set-piece to give Leicester a first-half lead. ""He is a wonderful technician at a dead-ball situation or sliding passes through,"" Rodgers said. ""He is a wonderful talent.

englishFootball,"Harry Maguire was sent off after just four minutes following a last-man foul on Johann Berg Gudmundsson but Leicester took the lead when James Maddison curled home a superb free-kick on 33 minutes. Dwight McNeil levelled five minutes later (38) for the hosts with a fine finish but although Burnley had pressure, substitute Morgan nodded in Youri Tielemans' deflected cross at the death to give Leicester an unlikely victory. Burnley made one change from the 4-2 loss to Liverpool. Johann Gudmundsson replaced Jeff Hendrick. Otherwise, it was the same 18 which went to Anfield.Brendan Rodgers kept faith with the same side which beat Fulham. In fact, the entire squad was unchanged from that 3-1 success. The result keeps Burnley 17th, two points above the relegation zone, while Leicester remain 10th. With relegation adversaries Cardiff and Southampton not in action, the Clarets had the chance to steal a march on their rivals in the battle to avoid the drop. Those attempts were seemingly boosted almost from the outset as England international Maguire was dismissed after a clash of legs with the recalled Gudmundsson. Despite being at a numerical disadvantage it was Leicester who took the lead after Maddison was bundled to the floor by James Tarkowski and then stepped up to impressively bend the resulting free-kick past Tom Heaton. Jamie Vardy was denied by Heaton, who was recalled by England this week, and less than a minute later the Foxes were made to pay for not doubling their lead. Burnley:  Heaton 7, Bardsley 6, Tarkowski 4, Mee 6, Taylor 7; Gudmundsson 6, Westwood 5, Cork 6, McNeil 7; Barnes 5, Wood 6Subs:  Brady 5, Crouch 6, Vydra 6Leicester:  Schmeichel 6; Pereira 5, Evans 7, Maguire 2, Chilwell 6; Tielemans 7, Ndidi 8, Maddison 7; Gray 3, Vardy 6, Barnes 7Subs:  Morgan 8, Mendy 6, Fuchs 7Man of the match:  Wilfried Ndidi Charlie Taylor got free on the left and picked out England Under-20 newbie McNeil on the edge of the box, who swept the ball beyond Kasper Schmeichel with aplomb. Though referee Michael Oliver thought otherwise, there is little doubt Wilfried Ndidi's trip on Charlie Taylor in the second half should have resulted in a penalty. The start of the second half followed a more predictable pattern, with the home side enjoying much of the ball as they tried to make their man advantage count. Ashley Barnes spurned the best of the opportunities, scooping over the bar after McNeil's teasing cross. Sean Dyche's side should have had a penalty when Wilfred Ndidi clumsily tripped Charlie Taylor but referee Michael Oliver waves away the appeals. And that decision would prove to be decisive as a late bout of Leicester pressure led to captain Morgan - who had earlier replaced Demarai Gray after Maguire's red card - rising highest to head Tielemans' cross into the corner to spark scenes of delirium among the travelling fans. While Rodgers is now off the mark with Leicester away from home, defeat is a major blow to Burnley's hopes of avoiding the drop following a record-equalling fourth Premier League defeat in a row. Leicester offered very little in attack for long periods, and it required a heroic effort from the Nigerian at times to stem the Burnley flow. Though perhaps fortunate not to concede a penalty, he was otherwise key to protecting a weakened back four and snuffing out any threat - laying the platform for the late winner. Brendan Rodgers: ""A real team performance. The guys coming off the bench had to have an impact as well to give us that energy and all-round it was an incredible three points. ""You always fancy it at 1-1 and we got a corner late on. They defend it well, it comes out and then Youri whips a great ball in and the big guy gets up and has done what he's done. A great header. ""You see the spirit in the team. The emotion that they show together and they were worth of it."" Sean Dyche: ""They went to 10 men and I think it was so early it kind of shocked us and we didn't get to grips with it. ""You always fear a set-piece late on. We don't stop the cross, we don't deal with it before that actually. We give away a really poor corner for no reason, we don't stop the cross and they get a bit of fortune with it bouncing off Charlie Taylor's leg and onto Morgan's head. ""He [Ndidi] definitely clips him [Taylor] but a natural fall. You don't get them for natural falls. If he goes rolling around on the floor he's got a chance. I don't think you get them for natural falls. It is a shame because that is the way the game is going."" Following the international break, Burnley host Wolves while Leicester welcome Bournemouth on March 30."
englishFootball,"A stunning second-half performance, capped by goals from Richarlison and Gylfi Sigurdsson, secured the Toffees their first victory over one of the Premier League's established powerhouse clubs since their 4-0 demolition of Manchester City in January 2017. Everton dent Chelsea top-four hopesEverton 2-0 Chelsea: As it happened Silva admitted Everton were second best in the first half - during which Chelsea struck the post with one of their 10 attempts on goal - but praised his players for implementing their game plan with such precision. ""I don't have doubts about what I'm doing I'm the first one that wants more consistency,"" the Portuguese said. ""[We want] to be more mature to achieve everything we want, deserve and what our fans deserve also. ""The first half I didn't like it at all, we were not there from the first minute. What we did in the second half was everything we planned during the week. ""I told our players at half-time that they have to do everything different And they did. They showed great attitude, character and personality second half, but we have to do it from the first minute. ""Desire is a strong word. We weren't without desire. They work really hard every day, I can't say anything about their attitude. ""But maybe we weren't focused on our role. What I saw in the second half is what we do every day in training."""
englishFootball,"Beardsley left his role as Newcastle United's U23 coach earlier in March following a 14-month internal investigation after a complaint was made by midfielder Yasin Ben El-Mhanni. El-Mhanni, of Moroccan descent, accused Beardsley of humiliating him, which was supported by some of his team-mates. The FA confirmed earlier this week that they are investigating the allegations made against Beardsley, and the 58-year-old former England international has reiterated his denial of the accusations. He told The Mirror: ""I'm not a bully, and I'm not a racist. ""Everybody in the city of Newcastle has been amazing, for 15 months, they've been amazing. ""I know what I am and everybody who knows me, my family, my friends, knows what I am. I'm comfortable with what I am. It is what it is, I'm just ready to move on."" Beardsley has to clear his name with the FA to continue working in English football. Evidence from Newcastle's probe will be handed over."
englishFootball,"The Ivory Coast dangerman sat out Crystal Palace's 2-1 defeat at Watford in the FA Cup quarter-finals on Saturday, in a game where the Eagles struggled to create chances. After the game, Hodgson lamented the loss of Palace's prime attacking threat, and questioned whether it might have made the difference in a tight game at Vicarage Road. He said: ""He's an outstanding player, when you take players of that quality in a team you're not going to be able to say you didn't miss them, you never know what sort of game they're going to have. ""We don't really want to go into an important quarter-final without players of his ability and his importance. So that was a bit unfortunate as, of course, has been the Mamadou Sakho injury. ""He (Zaha) felt his hamstring after the Brighton game, he didn't train, during the week we took him out to test it on Thursday but it would have been an enormous risk to play him in the game today and risk more serious injury. We can only hope he'll recover in the two weeks before the next game."" Hodgson felt his side had been undone by a piece of quality in Watford's winning goal 11 minutes from time rather than anything more habitual, and said he had felt confident that his side would go on to win when the scores were level. He said: ""The second-half performance was good. The game was dominated by the weather conditions, as are so many at this time of year, I thought it was a tight encounter. ""You have to weather the storm in the first half, we couldn't get the ball away from the corner flag. But we started to look more dangerous after half-time and when we equalised I was feeling fairly good about the team and our chances of winning."""
englishFootball,"Millwall were leading the tie 2-0 heading into the 88th minute, but late goals from Jurgen Locadia and Solly March saw the game go to extra-time before Brighton won the shootout. Lions manager Harris says his Millwall side were better and a human error from goalkeeper David Martin - who let March's free-kick slip through his fingers - cost them a semi-final place. ""What an outstanding performance for 94 minutes,"" he said. ""First and foremost, I feel for Dave Martin. He was excellent throughout the game, commanded his box and made some saves. It was a good kick in but he made a slight error of judgement and it's cost us. ""He's a top pro and one of the nicest players I've ever come across in football. The way my team played, the running ability, some of our play with the ball, the two goals we scored - it was all great play and what gives me the most pride is that we were better than Brighton today. ""Our opportunity to win the quarter-final was 2-0 up in the 88th minute. Would I change anything I did? Not at all because the players on the pitch should have been capable of seeing out a two-goal lead with the amount of defensive players and leadership we had on the pitch. What you can't do is legislate for human error and that's what cost us."" Millwall will now focus on the Sky Bet Championship as they look to steer themselves out of a relegation battle with nine games of the season to play. Harris added: ""For me today, we matched and surpassed a Brighton side that is doing really well in the Premier League. We've now got nine cup finals left. This has been a great adventure, the FA Cup, and we've had some great games and we have to take those battling qualities into those nine cup finals. ""The biggest game by far is Leeds away in two weeks. We'll enjoy the break and then we've got five games at The Den in the last eight games of the season."" Brighton have now made it to their first FA Cup semi-final since 1983 and will face Manchester City, but despite the seemingly daunting opponent, manager Chris Hughton says anything can happen on the day. ""It's very difficult to get to this stage of the competition so you know it isn't going to come round too often,"" he said. ""When it does, I think you have to big up the occasion as much as possible, praise those that have got us there and try to enjoy it the best we can. ""I don't think I am saying anything out of turn when I say that the three of us [Brighton and other semi-finalists, Wolves and Watford] would have wanted to avoid Man City. At this moment, they are one of the best teams in the world and still going in four competitions. ""But as this weekend showed, teams can get close, there can be upsets and if you have enough going for you, and the opposition don't have one of their better days, who knows what can happen."" VAR has also been back in the spotlight this weekend, with Sky Bet Championship grounds not having the technology, although a few incidents needed it at The Den on Sunday, particularly for Brighton. Hughton added: ""The feeling was that we should have had a penalty for a foul on Duffy, there was a foul on the build-up to the first goal and Montoya being through [he was flagged offside in the last minute of extra-time but was onside]. ""I don't think it's fair that some games don't have VAR. if I'm a team who has benefited from it in one game, I certainly don't think it's fair on the teams that don't benefit from it."""
englishFootball,"The 20-year-old Frenchman, who can operate as a right-back or right midfielder, has become a regular starter under Ralph Hasenhuttl, making his top-flight debut under the Austrian against Manchester United in January. Valery has gone on to feature in 16 Premier League games this season, scoring in his last two matches against United and Tottenham respectively, the latter of which sparked a late comeback which saw the Saints win 2-1 on Saturday. ""Yan's development has been fantastic in the last few months,"" Hasenhuttl said. ""I think he is a player who embodies precisely the philosophy of Southampton, as he is young and forward-thinking. ""He has been given trust by us, and in return he has shown exactly what we want to see, which is a brave player who believes in himself and is willing to work on his deficits to get better. ""Already you can see Yan has improved defensively, and his goals against teams like Manchester United and Tottenham are big signs of how much his confidence has been growing."" Valery added that he is now focused on helping 16th-placed Southampton keep their place in the Premier League next season. ""It's a big step,"" he said. ""It proves the club believe in me, and I am really proud and happy to sign again for this club. It is the club that gave me my chance.

englishFootball,"The Foxes centre-back was dismissed after just four minutes at Turf Moor for a last-man foul on Johann Berg Gudmundsson. Dwight McNeil cancelled out James Maddison's free-kick and the Clarets dominated the second half in search of the lead. But substitute Wes Morgan popped up in the 90th minute to secure a 2-1 win to leave the East Lancashire club two points above the relegation zone in 17th. Dyche feels the hosts never settled after their opponents were reduced to 10 men and feels it was significant to the outcome. ""First half we didn't get to grips with it really,"" said the 47-year-old. ""They went to 10 men and I think it was so early it kind of shocked us and we didn't get to grips with it. ""Second half we adjusted it and we kept the ball better without really breaking them open. But it is difficult. Teams bank in with a 4-4-1 as they often do and they look for a counter. ""They didn't really counter many times and in the end they win it on a soft set-piece from our point of view."" Though Burnley enjoyed ample possession as Leicester went into survival mode after half-time, they carved out precious few opportunities to go in front. Ashley Barnes spurned the best of them, lifting the ball over from McNeil's centre. Dyche's team should arguably have had a second-half penalty when Wilfred Ndidi tripped Charlie Taylor, but referee Michael Oliver was unmoved amid the protests. Dyche feels the honesty of Taylor, 25, was his eventual undoing. ""He definitely clips him but [it's a] natural fall,"" he added. ""You don't get them for natural falls. If he goes rolling around on the floor he's got a chance. ""I don't think you get them for natural falls. It is a shame because that is the way the game is going. It looks like a pen to me. ""I'm not making it about that, that is for the game to sort out. We should do enough to win a game and we haven't done that."" Having missed the chance to go five points clear of the bottom three with many of their rivals not playing, Burnley have the international break to contemplate their bleak position in the table. They face key games against Wolves and at Bournemouth following the resumption of the domestic season, before a relegation six-pointer with 18th-placed Cardiff City. ""The clarity has to come,"" Dyche explained. ""[The international break] gives the chance for the players to clear their minds. ""They'll be disappointed today as well as I am.

englishFootball,"After Ryan Babel had cancelled out Sadio Mane's equaliser at Craven Cottage, Sergio Rico's late foul on Sadio Mane allowed Liverpool to grab a win via a James Milner penalty, meaning Fulham sit 19th following seven straight defeats. Their chances of survival are slim with seven games remaining, sitting 13 points from safety, and caretaker manager Parker could not hide his disappointment after a hard-fought second half. Asked if Fulham had thrown the game away, Parker told Sky Sports: ""Yeah probably. Gutted, disappointed, mainly for the players really. I said before the day how hard everyone has been working this week. ""Even as slow as we were in the first half in the attacking third, I saw things which were part of what we want, and then certainly second half."" Parker was easy on his goalkeeper Rico for the late penalty, which came after the goalkeeper had spilled a simple Mo Salah shot before grabbing at Mane. ""You see it every week, when a player makes a mistake, his first action is to try and put it right, and nine times out of 10 the first thing they do when they've made a mistake is take out everyone in front of them because they want to make amends. ""Sergio has pulled off some great saves today but he's obviously made a little error there."" Parker's job interview for the full-time managerial position has consisted of three straight defeats so far, but the former Fulham midfielder is confident the club are moving in the right direction. ""This is a process, it's something that will take time, but I see some evidence to suggest we're moving in the right direction. ""Listen, I said it two weeks ago, I said it after the last games, my message is the same, and to the players, this group have quality. What we have lacked at times this year is fight.

notEnglishFootballDocs,"The House of Commons will be given the choice of various Brexit outcomes through a series of so-called indicative votes. It comes after the government was defeated in the Commons and failed to stop a proposal spearheaded by former Tory minister Sir Oliver Letwin from being approved by MPs. His plan has seized control of the parliamentary timetable from the government for Wednesday. It is up to Speaker John Bercow as to what options will be voted on, but Sir Oliver has said that all ""serious"" proposals should have a chance to be considered. So, what are the likely Brexit options MPs will be voting on and how will the votes work? Revoke Article 50 Article 50 is the clause which triggered the UK's withdrawal from the EU and gave the country two years to negotiate an exit deal. A petition to revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit passed five million signatures on Sunday. The prime minister is set against cancelling the UK's departure from the EU, claiming it would cause distrust of politicians for failing to deliver on the result of the EU referendum. Second referendum A second referendum would see decision-making on Brexit taken back to the public - likely including the option of remaining in the EU. The People's Vote campaign claimed one million people joined its march in favour of a second EU referendum in London on Saturday. A Sky Data poll in January found that most Britons do not want a second EU referendum, with 56% saying they were opposed to another vote. PM's deal MPs have twice rejected Theresa May's Brexit deal, with the prime minister admitting she is still yet to garner enough support to bring it back for a third vote in the Commons. EU leaders recently granted the prime minister's request to delay Brexit, on the condition that her deal is passed by the end of this week. PM's deal with customs union Another option is a softer version of the prime minister's deal, which would see the UK remain within the EU's customs union. This means goods can pass between the UK and the EU without checks or duties, but there will still be tariffs for non-EU goods. However, it would severely limit the UK's ability to sign independent trade deals with non-EU countries. PM's deal with customs union and single market membership This option would also include membership of the EU's single market - which guarantees the free movement of goods, capital, services and labour across the bloc. The prime minister has repeatedly stated ending free movement of people is among her top priorities in order to honour the 2016 Brexit vote. Standard free trade agreement Brexiteers have long argued the UK should sign a free trade deal with the EU along the lines of Canada's agreement with the bloc. This would see the vast majority of goods be traded tariff-free between the UK and EU, but leave the UK outside the bloc's customs union and single market. The prime minister argues this would not prevent the establishment of a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. No-deal Brexit This final option would leave the UK with no agreements in place for its departure or what its future relationship with the EU will look like. It has been argued this could cause chaos at the UK's borders and see a hit to the economy, while also not providing protections for EU citizens living in the UK and British expats living on the continent. It could also see a hard border established on the island of Ireland, and the ending of UK-EU security co-operation. Sky News recently revealed the armed forces have activated a team in a nuclear-proof bunker under the Ministry of Defence as the government prepares for a potential no-deal Brexit. However, Brexiteers argue a no-deal Brexit would mean the UK wouldn't have to pay a Â£39bn divorce fee and could immediately reduce tariffs on goods coming into the country. How will it work? At 2pm on Wednesday, the normal business in the Commons will stop. MPs will then consider a backbench motion setting out the future business in the chamber, including the arrangements for holding the indicative votes. If more than one business motion is tabled, Speaker John Bercow will decide which one is selected. Sir Oliver said he hoped to be able to work with the government and Labour to come to an agreement about how the process will work. After a debate of up to an hour, the Commons will then begin considering the options that have been put forward. How long will it take? This is not clear, but Sir Oliver has suggested it could be a long process which takes several days. He has proposed that MPs begin on a ""plain vanilla basis"", with the Commons voting on the various options on paper slips all at once at the end of the first debate. This would be different to the normal practice, which sees MPs go through lobbies in a series of divisions of around 15 minutes each. Sir Oliver has said he thinks this would stop MPs voting tactically based on the sequence in which the votes are called. He added that once it has been established which proposals have ""significant"" support, a way would have to be found for MPs to ""zero in"" on the most popular option, perhaps through a form of preferential voting system. Will the government be bound by what MPs decide? Not necessarily. Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs on Tuesday that she was ""sceptical"" about the process, which ""could lead to an outcome that is un-negotiable with the EU"". ""No government could give a blank cheque to commit to an outcome without knowing what it is,"" she said. ""So I cannot commit the government to delivering the outcome of any votes held by this House, but I do commit to engaging constructively with this process."" This was reiterated by Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, who said MPs may come up with something that is ""entirely undeliverable."" Such talk prompted Tory former minister Nick Boles to warn that MPs could bring forward legislation forcing the government to act if ministers try to ignore Parliament."
notEnglishFootballDocs,"Theresa May is expected to face pressure to name her departure date when she faces her MPs later, amid signs that Conservative rebels are reluctantly ready to back her deal in a third vote. The prime minister will address the 1922 committee as she battles to save her withdrawal agreement, which has already been rejected twice by MPs. There have been suggestions that giving a time-frame for her exit from Number 10 will unlock more votes and see her party fall into line behind the deal. Mrs May's spokesman said the PM is ""totally focused on the job at hand and remains so"". At Prime Minister's Questions, Mrs May faced calls from the opposition to quit, while one of her own backbenchers claimed she will never be trusted again due to her handling of Brexit. In response to criticism from Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, she said MPs could still guarantee delivering on Brexit ""if this week he and others in this House support the deal"". SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford told the Commons: ""It is becoming increasingly clear that the cost the prime minister will pay to force her disastrous deal through is the price of her departure. ""Yet again another Tory prime minister is willing to ride off into the sunset and saddle us with a crisis in the UK and an extreme right-wing Brexiteer coming into Downing Street. ""Does the prime minister feel no sense of responsibility for what she is about to do?"" Mrs May did not directly deny suggestions she was about to name a date for her departure, saying: ""It is my sense of responsibility and duty that has meant I have kept working to ensure Brexit is delivered."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hit out at the ""chaotic and incompetent"" government and pushed the PM to tell MPs what her ""plan B"" is. The Commons clashes comes ahead of MPs voting on a range of Brexit alternatives in so-called ""indicative votes"". They will likely be able to express their opinion on a variety of potential ways forward - including a second referendum and a ""soft"" Brexit involving closer links with the EU - but the government has already said it will not be bound by what MPs decide. Labour has confirmed that its MPs will be whipped to support the call for a second referendum on any Brexit deal passed by Parliament. The government's unease with the process was underlined by Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, who said she was ""very concerned about the far-reaching implications"" of MPs taking control of the parliamentary agenda. Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group of eurosceptic Conservative MPs, said it was part of a ""concerted attempt"" to stop Brexit. Mr Rees-Mogg is among those who has softened his opposition to the PM's deal, saying although it has ""many faults"" it is ""at least legally leaving the European Union"". Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has hinted he could back the agreement, provided Mrs May says when she will go. ""There's no point in supporting this deal without any sign that the UK is going to change its approach in phase two,"" he said."
notEnglishFootballDocs,"The DUP now consider a long extension to Brexit to be preferable to the prime minister's deal, Sky News understands.Â  Some in the party believe if the prime minister is forced by MPs to request a longer extension, there may be a change of Conservative leader to someone who could force through a different deal. The party has been in talks with deputy prime minister David Lidington over the government's offer of a ""Stormont lock"" to ensure new EU laws applied in Northern Ireland would be accepted by the rest of the UK under the backstop arrangements. It is understood the talks broke up in acrimony last Tuesday amid concerns that such an arrangement would never be acceptable to some Tory Brexiteers or the other devolved administrations. A source close to those talks told Sky News the party's MPs are moving towards ""a long extension, perhaps a year or more, which would mean a change of leader and a different approach"". The party's MPs have discussed the fact that while the EU's permission would be needed to leave the backstop, if Britain secured a long extension as an EU member, it could decide not to renew it at any time. A long extension would need to be agreed by all 27 remaining members of the European Union, but the French president warned against it at the EU summit last week. Emmanuel Macron said: ""In the case of a negative vote in the British parliament, we will be going to a no deal. We all know that. ""It is absolutely essential to be clear in these days and these moments, because it is a matter of the good functioning of the EU. ""We cannot have what I would call an excessive extension which would harm our capacity to decision and to act."" DUP MPs have resolutely opposed the Withdrawal Agreement, saying the backstop arrangements will lead to the breakup of the union and tie the UK into the EU's orbit indefinitely. Downing Street had hoped that support from the DUP at the eleventh hour would bring enough of the hardline Brexiteers in the Conservative Party over to the government's side to cobble together a majority with some Labour support. But Sammy Wilson, the DUP's Brexit spokesman, said on Sky News earlier that no deal was preferable to the prime minister's ""toxic"" withdrawal agreement, which is expected to be brought back to parliament this week. The MP for East Antrim said: ""She still has huge difficulties in her own party. ""A number have left her own party who are determined to vote against the withdrawal agreement, many in her own party who, regardless of what we would do, will be voting against it... why would we vote for an agreement which cuts Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK, which keeps the United Kingdom in the customs union and the single market."" Following Sky's exclusive report, Mr Wilson wrote in the Daily Telegraph: ""Even if we are forced into a one year extension, we would at least have a say on the things which affect us during that time and would have the right to unilaterally decide to leave at the end of that one-year period through the simple decision of not applying for a further extension. ""Surely this is a better strategy than volunteering to be locked into the prison of the withdrawal deal with the cell door key in the pocket of [EU negotiator] Michel Barnier?"" Members of the European Research Group are split on whether to support the prime minister's deal, with several now supporting it in order to deliver Brexit in the coming weeks rather than accept a softer version or a longer extension. Brexiteer lawyer Martin Howe QC has suggested a long extension of Article 50 would be preferable to supporting the prime minister's deal."
notEnglishFootballDocs,"Theresa May has admitted there is still not enough support to bring back her Brexit deal for a third vote in the House of Commons - but failed to commit to chasing an alternative strategy. The prime minister updated MPs on Monday after agreeing a delay to Brexit with EU leaders at a Brussels summit last week. The UK will now leave the bloc on 22 May, although this is conditional on parliament finally approving Mrs May's Brexit deal by the end of this week. Without MPs agreeing to the prime minister's withdrawal agreement, the Brexit date will instead come sooner on 12 April. Mrs May told the Commons it is her ""great regret"" that ""as things stand, there is still not sufficient support in the House to bring back the deal for a third meaningful vote"". Her admission came after a phone call with Arlene Foster, the DUP leader whose party props up Mrs May's government at Westminster. After the pair's conversation, the Northern Ireland party announced its opposition to the prime minister's deal ""remains unchanged"". In her statement, Mrs May suggested the continuing absence of approval for her deal would see a ""slow Brexit"" with a longer delay to the UK's exit from the EU that would see the country take part in European Parliament elections and ""gives up control of any of our borders, laws, money or trade"". The prime minister also claimed a no-deal Brexit would not happen without MPs' approval, who have previously voted against such an outcome, while Mrs May added: ""No Brexit must not happen."" Downing Street later denied the prime minister's words meant she herself was ruling out a no-deal Brexit. On Monday evening, MPs are due to vote on a proposal for MPs to seize control of the parliamentary timetable for a day in order to hold so-called indicative votes on alternate Brexit outcomes. Mrs May told the Commons her government would oppose this move as an ""unwelcome precedent"" that would ""overturn the balance of our democratic institutions"". But she promised the government would itself provide parliamentary time for indicative votes on Brexit options. Yet, the prime minister warned MPs she ""cannot commit"" to delivering an alternative Brexit outcome that the Commons supported ""The UK is only one half of the equation and the votes could lead to an outcome that is unnegotiable with the EU,"" she said. Taking questions after her statement, Mrs May signalled she would not seek to drop her Brexit red lines and negotiate a post-Brexit customs union with the EU, even if a majority of MPs voted in favour of it. The prime minister suggested this would breach the Conservative manifesto from the 2017 general election. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who backs a permanent customs union with the EU, told MPs it was ""time for this parliament to work together and agree on a Plan B"". He added: ""If she is brave the prime minister would help facilitate this."" Earlier, the EU issued a statement on the prospect of a no-deal Brexit - which it claimed was an ""increasingly likely"" scenario. Brussels said that if Britain leaves without an agreement in place, it will not benefit from a transition period to new arrangements, but will immediately be subject to checks and tariffs on its exports to the EU. It said this would be expected to cause ""significant delays"" at borders. The statement added: ""The EU's contingency measures will not - and cannot - mitigate the overall impact of a no-deal scenario, nor do they in any way compensate for the lack of preparedness or replicate the full benefits of EU membership or the favourable terms of any transition period, as provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement. ""These proposals are temporary in nature, limited in scope and will be adopted unilaterally by the EU. They are not 'mini-deals' and have not been negotiated with the UK. ""The EU has maintained - and will continue to maintain - a fully united position throughout its preparations, and during any possible no-deal period."""
notEnglishFootballDocs,"The House of Commons is preparing for another week dominated by Brexit, as Theresa May's position looks increasingly uncertain. The prime minister spent Sunday afternoon in crisis meetings at her country residence, Chequers, where she tried to persuade fellow Conservatives to back her Brexit agreement. :: Follow today's events as MPs seek to take control of Brexit Among the attendees were prominent Brexiteer backbenchers including Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg and David Davis. But her office gave no hint as to the degree of her success, saying in a statement that the MPs had discussed ""whether there is sufficient support"" to bring her plan back to Parliament for a third vote. Mrs May had previously indicated that she may not bring her deal back to parliament this week if there is still not enough support for it. Meanwhile, Sunday newspapers had reported that a cabinet coup was under way, with a growing number of MPs putting pressure on the prime minister to set a date for her departure. Without approval for her deal, Mrs May would be left humiliated and that pressure could grow stronger. MPs are due to vote on a series of amendments this week aimed at influencing the Brexit process. A proposal led by former Tory ministers Sir OIiver Letwin and Dominic Grieve, together with Labour's Hilary Benn, will attempt to seize control of parliamentary business away from the government. This would then allow indicative votes to be held in the House of Commons on different Brexit options, in the hope that a majority of MPs will be found for one such alternative. It would also effectively take control of the Brexit process out of the hands of the government. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has warned that such a move could bring about a ""constitutional collision"" and increase the risk of a general election. Mr Johnson, meanwhile, said the government had ""chickened out"" of delivering Brexit and that Mrs May needed to set out ""convincing proofs"" showing that the next phase of negotiations would be different before her deal could be supported. Writing in the Telegraph, he said: ""If she cannot give that evidence of change - she should drop the deal, and go back to Brussels, and simply set out the terms that so many on both sides - Remainers and Leavers - now believe are sensible. ""Extend the implementation period to the end of 2021 if necessary; use it to negotiate a free trade deal; pay the fee; but come out of the EU now - without the backstop. It is time for the PM to channel the spirit of Moses in Exodus, and say to Pharaoh in Brussels - let my people go."""
notEnglishFootballDocs,"Theresa May has days left in Downing Street amid a cabinet coup to oust her, according to several reports. Speculation the prime minister will be ousted is at fever pitch, with The Sunday Times reporting 11 cabinet ministers had told them they want Mrs May to move aside and make way for a replacement. Her de facto deputy David Lidington has been named as her potential caretaker replacement, while several are said to be ready to throw their weight behind Environment Secretary Michael Gove. Her former policy adviser George Freeman tweeted it was ""all over for the PM"", adding: ""She's done her best. But across the country you can see the anger. ""Everyone feels betrayed. Government's gridlocked. Trust in democracy collapsing. This can't go on. We need a new PM who can reach out (and) build some sort of coalition for a Plan B."" Former education secretary Nicky Morgan told The Sunday Telegraph cabinet ministers should tell her ""it's time to go"" while backbench Brexiteer Steve Baker says potential leadership contenders should ""act now"". Conservative backbencher Ann-Marie Trevelyan wrote: ""We now need a leader who believes in our country and wants to take her on the next stage of her journey."" According to Buzzfeed, the prime minister was told to think about leaving office by several of her whips during a meeting, but Mrs May was ""unmoved"", refusing to believe it would make any difference to the deal. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, former Brexit secretary David Davis said leaving on World Trade Organisation terms, also called a no-deal Brexit, looked ""much better than the other options in front of us"". He said: ""If parliament rejects the deal on offer, the prime minister has it in her power to deliver a WTO outcome. That is what she should do. ""And if some ministers resign as a result? That would be a pity, but there are always volunteers to replace every departure."" It comes as up to one million people marched through London to demand a 'People's Vote', calling for the deal to be put to the people with the option to remain in the European Union. Pro-Brexit campaigners are continuing their march from the North East to the capital, and on Saturday, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage addressed some of the supporters. Mrs May spent the weekend on the campaign trail in Milton Keynes and in her country retreat of Chequers, no doubt mulling over the events of a turbulent week, in which she had blamed MPs for the Brexit delay and then said she may not bring her deal back to the Commons for a third time if there was not enough support to pass it. She came under fire for a speech which blamed MPs for the impasse, saying ""all MPs have been willing to say is what they don't want"". In a letter to parliamentarians on Friday she appeared to apologise, and said she might not bring the deal back again, writing: ""If it appears that there is not sufficient support to bring the deal back next week, or the House rejects it again, we can ask for another extension before 12 April."" She also acknowledged the ""difficult job"" all MPs face, and said it was not her intention to make it harder. Mrs May said she was holding Brexit meetings over the weekend, sharing pictures as she joined local election efforts in Milton Keynes."

In a letter to her fellow parliamentarians, she wrote: ""If it appears that there is not sufficient support to bring the deal back next week, or the House rejects it again, we can ask for another extension before 12 April."" The prime minister set out four options available following the EU's acceptance of a delayed departure date. :: The first option Mrs May sets out in her letter - to revoke Article 50 - would ""betray the result of the referendum"", she writes. :: She explains how the second option, leaving the EU with no deal on 12 April, has already been rejected by MPs. :: The third, pulling the next vote, could see her approach the EU for another extension which would see the UK remain in the EU during the European parliamentary elections. :: The final option she offers is to simply carry on as planned: bring the vote next week, approve it, and leave on 22 May. :: Backstop? Customs union? Brexit jargon explained The prime minister also extended an offer to MPs to speak to her directly if they wish to in order to help them reach a decision. Mrs May, who made a combative late-night speech on Wednesday, appeared to offer a conciliatory note to her colleagues. She wrote: ""I expressed my frustration with our failure to take a decision, but I know many of your are frustrated too. ""You have a difficult job to do and it was not my intention to make it any more difficult."" The Democratic Unionists - whose support will be crucial if the Government is to win a third vote - have indicated they would not back her deal. The DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds has lamented the PM's failure to secure any changes to the Northern Ireland backstop while in Brussels. ""Nothing has changed as far as the Withdrawal Agreement is concerned. We will not accept any deal which poses a long-term risk to the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom,"" he said. It comes as Number 10 is understood to be considering allowing parliament to vote on seven alternative options next week, amid growing fears that Theresa May will not get her Brexit plan through the House of Commons. A senior minister in the government told Sky News that plans are being drawn up to give MPs a choice between revoking Article 50, a second referendum, the prime minister's deal, her deal plus a customs union, the deal plus a customs union and single market access, a standard free trade agreement, or a no-deal Brexit. Meanwhile, a petition demanding Mrs May revokes Article 50 and cancels Brexit has passed 3.6 million signatures. The petition says: ""The government repeatedly claims exiting the EU is 'the will of the people'. ""We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now, for remaining in the EU. A People's Vote may not happen - so vote now."" The petition has had the highest rate of signatures on record - and at one point, it caused the official petitions website to crash. Actors Hugh Grant and Jennifer Saunders promoted the petition on social media, as did physicist Brian Cox."
notEnglishFootballDocs,"The US says it will put astronauts back on the moon within five years ""by any means necessary"". NASA carried out six manned flights to earth's satellite between 1969 and 1972. Fears that the US may be falling behind in the space race and president Trump's desire for a flagship project to champion as he mounts a re-election bid are thought to be behind the acceleration of the project to send Americans back to the moon. The US military is also wary of potential space weaponry capabilities of rival superpowers Russia and China. Both countries have landed unmanned craft on the moon. NASA had originally planned a manned mission by 2028, after first putting a ""gateway"" station in orbit around the moon by 2024. Announcing the new timetable at a meeting of the National Space Council in Alabama, vice president Mike Pence said: ""We're in a space race today, just as we were in the 1960s."" And in a nod to the words of Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon, he added: ""It's time for the next giant leap. ""That next giant leap is to return American astronauts to the moon within the next five years by any means necessary, and to establish a permanent presence on the moon and prepare to put American astronauts on Mars."" He went on: ""In order to accomplish this, NASA must transform itself into a leaner, more accountable and more agile organisation."" That last comment is being viewed as a reference to the cost of the programme, likely to be tens of billions of dollars. Since shuttle missions ended in 2011 NASA has struggled to devise a suitable project for human space launches from US soil. Following Mr Pence's announcement NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a Twitter post: ""Challenge accepted. Now let's get to work."" NASA, along with Boeing, is currently developing its its next big rocket and capsule vehicle - the Space Launch System, or SLS, designed to carry crews and cargo beyond Earth orbit. It is also working with other companies such as SpaceX andr the Boeing-Lockheed Martin partnership United Launch Alliance, to get an uncrewed capsule into space by 2020. In November, NASA named nine US firms, including Lockheed Martin Corp, that would compete for funding under the space agency's renewed private-public partnership for developing technology to explore the lunar surface."
notEnglishFootballDocs,"Vladimir Putin is ready to improve ties with the US after Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign was cleared of colluding with Russia, the Kremlin has said. Russia's foreign ministry has called on the US to formally recognise the findings of the long-awaited Mueller investigation after Mr Trump said he had ""complete and total exoneration"". Responding to the special counsel report, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia had never interfered in elections in other countries and ""doesn't intend to do so"". He added: ""It's hard to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if it isn't there."" Mr Peskov said it was now up to the US to make the first move in improving relations with Russia, telling reporters: ""The ball is absolutely in their court."" Special counsel Robert Mueller spent almost two years examining alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, bringing charges against 34 people and three Russian companies. A summary of his main findings was released on Sunday which said there was no evidence that Mr Trump's campaign ""conspired or coordinated"" with Russia. The report does not exonerate the president of obstruction of justice, the US Justice Department said. However, the summary, sent by the US Attorney General William Barr to members of Congress, said there was not enough evidence to prove charges of obstruction. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Mr Trump will let Mr Barr decide whether the full report should be publicly released after calls from high-profile Democrats, adding the president was ""more than happy for any of this stuff to come out"". After the release of Mr Mueller's findings, Mr Trump wrote on Twitter: ""No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!"" He also tweeted several quotes from news reports about the investigation on Monday, including one that said it had found ""no Trump-Russia conspiracy"". Former FBI director James Comey, who headed the investigation before being fired by Mr Trump in May 2017, tweeted an image of himself in a forest surrounded by trees with the caption: ""So many questions."" Republican senator Lindsey Graham replied to the tweet, writing: ""Could not agree more. See you soon,"" implying Mr Comey may be called before Congress in the near future."
notEnglishFootballDocs,"The weaponisation of the Mueller report began as soon as Attorney General William Barr published his summary. ""The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."" With that line, cheers will have gone up at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, where the president was staying for the weekend. Donald Trump was jubilant, tweeting ""No Collusion. No Obstruction. Complete and Total EXONERATION. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!"" Later he told reporters the Mueller investigation ""was an illegal takedown that failed"". The statements came thick and fast. Donald Trump Jr railed at the ""sick"" and ""twisted"" media conspiracy that has overshadowed his father's presidency. For Donald Trump and the Republicans, on the face of it, the report is a gift as they head in to the 2020 campaign - a powerful example of a deep conspiracy to uncouple Mr Trump from power. But for the Democrats, the Mueller report represents something else entirely. They pointed to another line in the summary, relating specifically to obstruction of justice. It says that the special counsel did a thorough ""factual investigation"" into the actions of the president, and ""ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgement"". It goes on: ""The special counsel states that while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" Attorney General Barr wrote that the decision about whether or not President Trump's behaviour had crossed the threshold of criminality was left to him. And what was that decision? Mr Barr wrote: ""The report identifies no actions that, in our judgement, constitute obstructive conduct."" Democrats are not content to take the attorney general's word for it. They now have an even more compelling reason to fight tooth and nail to see not only Mr Mueller's entire report, but the evidence that underpins it, so they can decide for themselves. They will go all the way to the Supreme Court to try to make that happen, setting up an epic legal battle between the White House and Democrats in Congress. And thus the Mueller investigation has created two parallel worlds in Washington, a place where commonly agreed upon facts are already hard to come by. As long as the vast majority of the report remains secret, that will continue to be the case."

The president's announcement signalled a shift in US policy and comes ahead of the Israeli prime minister's planned visit to the White House next week. However, it has been met with condemnation from around the region - most notably from Syria, who Israel seized the area from during the 1967 Middle East war, annexing it in 1981. A foreign ministry statement said that Mr Trump's comments confirm ""the blind bias of the United States to the Zionist entity"", referring to Israel. It added the policy shift will not change ""the fact that the Golan was and will remain Arab and Syrian"". Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement that a change in the status of the Golan Heights would be a ""direct violation of United Nations decisions"". A spokesman for Iran's foreign ministry, quoted on state TV, said: ""This illegal and unacceptable recognition does not change the fact that it belongs to Syria."" The US president made his announcement on Twitter, writing: ""After 52 years it is time for the United States to fully recognise Israel's Sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which is of critical strategic and security importance to the State of Israel and Regional Stability!"" The Golan is internationally recognised as occupied territory and Syria has demanded its return as a condition in the event of a future peace agreement. Mr Trump's tweet was posted during his secretary of state Mike Pompeo's visit to Jerusalem, although Mr Pompeo declined to comment on the president's remarks. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked the US president for ""boldly"" recognising Israel's control over the territory. He tweeted: ""At a time when Iran seeks to use Syria as a platform to destroy Israel, President Trump boldly recognises Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Thank you President Trump!"""
notEnglishFootballDocs,"Donald Trump has come under fire from his own party after unleashing a bizarre tirade against the late Republican Senator John McCain. His attacks on Mr McCain, who died from brain cancer last year, came to a head during a speech at an Ohio factory on Wednesday night. Talking about Mr McCain's funeral he said: ""I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as president I had to approve."" ""I don't care about this, I didn't get a thank you. That's okay."" He also said: ""I never liked him much... I really probably never will."" Meghan McCain, the late senator's daughter, said the president had reached ""a new, bizarre low - attacking someone who is not here is a new low"". She added: ""If I had told my dad... he would think it is so hilarious that our president was so jealous of him that he was dominating the news cycle in death."" Mr McCain arranged his own funeral before he died and invited former presidents including Barack Obama, who beat him in the 2008 election, but not Mr Trump, who just signed off the arrangements. Mr Trump also repeated his complaint that Mr McCain voted against repealing Obamacare and that he was not supportive of military veterans. Over the weekend, Mr Trump tweeted that Mr McCain backed an unverified dossier that claimed there were links between Trump and Vladimir Putin. He went on to say that Mr McCain sent the dossier to the FBI and the media before the 2016 election, in an effort to discredit his candidacy. But now it would seem that Republicans are tired of the president's constant bashing of John McCain. In defence of Mr McCain, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tweeted that Mr McCain was a ""rare patriot and genuine American hero."" Georgian Senator Johnny Isakson called Mr Trump's comments ""deplorable"", and that he does not care ""if he's the president of the United States, owns all the real estate in New York or is building the greatest immigration system in the world"". Mitt Romney, who was the Republican candidate in the 2012 White House race said: ""I can't understand why the President would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend John McCain: heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and God"". Even some of Mr Trump's closest allies in the senate are criticising his comments, with Lindsey Graham saying: ""I think the president's comments about Sen. McCain hurt him more than they hurt the legacy of Sen. McCain."" ""A lot of people are coming to John's defence now... I don't like it when he says things about my friend John McCain."""

George Conway, the partner of White House aide Kellyanne Conway, has long criticised the US president - accusing him of lying and even claiming that Mr Trump is mentally unfit for office. Following a barrage of ill-tempered tweets sent by Mr Trump over the weekend, Mr Conway accused the president of having narcissistic personality disorder. The president replied: ""George Conway, often referred to as Mr. Kellyanne Conway by those who know him, is VERY jealous of his wife's success &amp; angry that I, with her help, didn't give him the job he so desperately wanted. I barely know him but just take a look, a stone cold LOSER &amp; husband from hell!"" Mr Conway then posted a brief response of Twitter, simply writing: ""You. Are. Nuts."" In 2017, it was reported that Mr Conway was in the running for a job at the Department for Justice, but he later withdrew himself from contention. The president insists the lawyer was actually turned down for the role. Following Mr Trump's latest Twitter outburst, Mr Conway told Reuters: ""The president seems determined to prove the point I've been making."" It is unprecedented in Washington for the spouse of an aide to criticise the president so publicly. The White House has largely stayed out of the public feud due to Mrs Conway's role in the government, but the president's son Eric did wade in in December - calling Mr Conway's actions ""horrible"". In an interview with The New York Times this week, Mr Conway said he uses Twitter to air his frustrations so that he does not argue with his wife when she gets home. He has also denied that he and his wife have a book or movie deal about their unusual situation - describing such a suggestion as ""absurd"". The lawyer refused to comment on whether his spat with the president has affected his career or his marriage. In an interview last year, Mrs Conway said she does not agree with her husband's analysis of the president. She also told the Washington Post that Mr Conway's anti-Trump stance was disrespectful to her, adding: ""It's a violation of basic decency, certainly, if not marital vows."""
notEnglishFootballDocs,"Donald Trump has overturned congress' decision to stop him building his border wall with Mexico, in the first veto of his presidency. The president declared a national emergency last month, in a move to secure around $5.7bn (Â£4.3bn) in funding for a border wall with Mexico, after a lengthy government shutdown over the issue. 12 Republicans voted with the Democrats on Thursday evening to back a resolution that disapproved of Mr Trump's emergency declaration. Speaking at the signing of the veto in the west wing of the White House, Mr Trump said that congress' decision to overturn the national emergency was ""dangerous"" and ""reckless"". He also reaffirmed his position to the border wall and said ""it is a tremendous national emergency... our immigration system is stretched beyond the breaking point"". ""Congress has the freedom to pass this resolution... I have the duty to veto it."" The president tweeted on Thursday evening after congress voted against his national emergency, saying he looked forward to issuing a veto on the move. By calling a national emergency, Mr Trump wants to divert billions of dollars to build the border wall from the defence budget. The national emergency is still facing several legal challenges in federal courts. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that another counter-vote, will be held on the 26 March. She also called the veto a ""lawless power grab"". In a statement she said: ""On March 26, the House will once again act to protect our Constitution and our democracy from the president's emergency declaration by holding a vote to override his veto."" That vote will need a two-thirds majority in congress - something which is thought to be unlikely to happen, given Mr Trump's support in the house."
notEnglishFootballDocs,"Astronomers have used a ground-breaking technique to observe a planet that lies 129 light years from Earth. The ""super-Jupiter"" has a stormy surface with swirling clouds of iron and silicate - and scientists are describing it as a world unlike any found in our own solar system. Known as HR8799e, the ball of gas is believed to be bigger and much younger than any planet orbiting the sun. Scientists usually have to use indirect methods to study such exoplanets because of the blinding light of their stars. However, astronomers managed to make direct observations using a technique that combines the light from multiple telescopes. This method, known as optical interferometry, enabled four telescopes to work as one - creating an imaging system that was sensitive enough to disentangle light from the planet and its parent star. The snappily named HR8799e was first discovered in 2010 as it orbited a star in the Pegasus constellation. Sylvestre Lacour, from the Paris Observatory in France and the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, said: ""Our observations suggest a ball of gas illuminated from the interior, with rays of warm light swirling through stormy patches of dark clouds."" Mr Lacour said the observations paint ""a picture of a dynamic atmosphere of a giant exoplanet at birth, undergoing complex physical and chemical processes"". The findings were made by Gravity, an instrument that combines four light beams from the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope Interferometer in Chile. Details about the exoplanet have been published in the Astronomy and Astrophysics journal. Last year, Gravity observed gas swirling at 30% the speed of light just outside the massive black hole at the centre of our galaxy, the Milky Way."

notEnglishFootballDocs,"Astronomers have discovered that a radio jet from the supermassive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way could be pointed almost directly towards the Earth. By incorporating the world's most powerful telescope, Alma, into an array of sky-scanning antennae, astronomers have managed to pinpoint the radio emission to a smaller region of space than previously thought. The Alma telescope - short for Atacama Large Millimetre Array - promises to probe deeper into space than ever before, and is made up of 50 antennae arranged over a 10km (6.2mile) radius. The $1.3bn (Â£870m) observatory is based in Chile and works by combining radio waves collected by the antennae to construct images of space. In a new paper led by University of Nijmegen PhD student Sara Issaoun published in the Astrophysical Journal, scientists have for the first time penetrated the foggy cloud of hot gas obscuring the black hole at the centre of our galaxy. They discovered that the radio emission comes from such a small region of space that it looks as though the jet is pointed almost directly at Earth. The team used a technique called very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) which effectively combined many telescopes into a virtual telescope the size of the whole Earth. In doing so, they mapped out the exact properties of the scattering of light which blocks out view of the black hole, known as Sagittarius A* - and by removing this scattering produced the first image of the black hole's surroundings. Ms Issaoun found that the high quality of the unscattered image of the black hole revealed the bulk of the radio emission to come from a region of space about 300 millionth of a degree in the sky. ""This may indicate that the radio emission is produced in a disk of in-falling gas rather than by a radio jet,"" explained Ms Issaoun, who tested several computer models against the data. ""However, that would make Sagittarius A* an exception compared to other radio-emitting black holes. The alternative could be that the radio jet is pointing almost at us."" Such a jet is unlikely to be possible to cause harm to the Earth, but could provide valuable data about the black hole. Future studies of the black hole which collect data at different wavelengths could help increase scientists' understanding of black holes."

The images show the lunar rover Jade Rabbit 2 after it was pictured by the explorer Chang'e 4, and vice versa. According to the Chinese space agency, the spacecrafts are working well after landing on the far side of the moon on 3 January. Among other images released is a 360-degree panorama stitched together from 80 photos taken by a camera on the lander after it released the rover on to the lunar surface. Just 12 hours after landing, the rover drove off onto the surface of the Earth's primary satellite. ""It's a small step for the rover, but one giant leap for the Chinese nation,"" Wu Weiren, the chief designer of China's lunar exploration project, told state television. ""This giant leap is a decisive move for our exploration of space and the conquering of the universe,"" he added. The Jade Rabbit 2 rover has six wheels and is powered for six-wheel drive, so even if wheels fail, others will independently continue, state media reported. According to machine translation, the Chinese lunar exploration programme (CLEP) stated: ""The Chinese and foreign scientific loads were working normally, and the detection data was valid. ""It is said that the scientific experiment project carried out smoothly and reached the established goal of the project, marking the successful completion of the mission."" Colour imbalances in the detectors used by the probe to take the first images made the surface look red as they were less sensitive to other wavelengths of light. The rover can drive at a maximum speed of 200 metres (220 yards) per hour, and climb up slopes of up to 20 degrees and navigate over obstacles 20cm (8in) tall. The probe, containing a lander and a rover, was launched on a Long March 3B rocket from Xichang in the south of the country on 8 December. Chang'e 4 and its three predecessors were named after a Chinese goddess, who legend says has lived on the moon for thousands of years."
notEnglishFootballDocs,"A frozen ""super-Earth"" discovered six light years from Earth could be capable of harbouring life, scientists have said. The rocky planet, at least 3.2 times the size of Earth, is orbiting Barnard's Star, one of the closest and most well studied red dwarf stars in the Galaxy and the sun's nearest neighbouring single star. Known as Barnard's star b, its surface temperatures are estimated at minus 150C. Despite this, scientists believe pockets of liquid water, warmed by geothermal activity, could lie beneath the ice capable of harbouring life. As a red dwarf, Barnard's star is smaller, older and much cooler than the sun. Although the planet is much closer to it than the Earth is to the sun, it's surface remains locked in a blanket of ice. Professor Carole Haswell, head of astronomy at the Open University and a member of the international team that announced the discovery in the journal Nature, said: ""While the starlight from Barnard's Star is too feeble for Barnard's Star b to have liquid water on its surface, Barnard's Star b probably has a similar temperature to Jupiter's moon Europa. ""Famously, Europa has a sub-surface ocean which has been considered as a potential habitat for life. It is possible Barnard's Star b may offer similar niches for life. ""Tantalisingly, super-Earths like Barnard's Star b probably sustain geothermal activity for longer than their lower mass counterparts. ""This could be helpful to life by providing sustained heat and the chemicals needed to build complex organic molecules. ""This new discovery offers exciting prospects to learn more about the galaxy's diversity of planetary systems, starting with our own solar system's near neighbours."" The existence of Barnard's star b was confirmed after two decades of observations by the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain using the radial velocity technique. This involves looking for light frequency variations that betray the ""wobble"" an orbiting planet imparts on a star. From these measurements astronomers are able to estimate a planet's mass and orbital period."
notEnglishFootballDocs,"A NASA probe has boldly gone where no spacecraft has gone before by flying to within a record distance of the sun. Less than three months after lift-off, the Parker Solar Probe has managed to get within 15 million miles of the surface of the star. As far away as that sounds (approximately 600 trips around the world), it is the closest any vessel has ever gotten to the sun. Its speed hit 213,000 miles per hour as it penetrated the outer solar atmosphere, which made it more than 900 times faster than the top speed ever recorded by a Formula One car. NASA will not re-establish contact with the probe until it is far enough from the sun to avoid any potential radio interference, but heliophysics division director Nicola Fox said scientists ""cannot wait to get the data"". But the journey is far from over for Parker, which - assuming it survives the harsh conditions - will make 23 even closer approaches to the sun over the next seven years. The next one is scheduled to happen in April. NASA is also expecting Parker - which launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida in August - to repeatedly break its own speed records, achieving a top speed of about 430,000 miles per hour in 2024. It has already become the fastest spacecraft of all-time, besting the speeds recorded by the German-American Helios 2 mission in April 1976. Meanwhile, in other news from the final frontier, staff at the ALMA Observatory in Chile have used data from the European Southern Observatory to reveal a never-before-seen colossal fountain of molecular gas. Powered by a black hole in the brightest galaxy of the Abell 2597 cluster some one billion light-years away, it is hoped that the unprecedented observation could shed light on the life cycle of galaxies."
notEnglishFootballDocs,"The Dutchman announced his retirement from football management in March after a 47-year career that began as a player at Ajax in 1972, before taking over the same club as manager in 1991. Van Gaal spent two years at Old Trafford, qualifying for the Champions League in his first season after the club had finished seventh the season before, and winning the FA Cup in what would turn out to be his final game in management. Looking back, van Gaal wondered whether White Hart Lane might have been a better destination for him in England, given the opportunity to work with young players. ""Tottenham were a better selection because Manchester United were an old team and I knew I would have to transform them,"" van Gaal told BBC Sport. ""Was it the wrong choice? Maybe, but I follow my heart. I worked at the number one team in the Netherlands, Germany, Spain and now also in England. ""They had seven players over 30. We spoke about that at the job interview. In my first year we qualified for the Champions League. In my second we won the FA Cup."" Van Gaal's tenure at Manchester United came to an infamous conclusion, as he was sacked shortly after beating Crystal Palace at Wembley. United had missed out on Champions League qualification on goal difference to Manchester City and supporter disgruntlement over perceived negative football was growing, as Leicester City stormed to an improbable Premier League title. Jose Mourinho was appointed van Gaal's successor, a story the media had been reporting since the previous December and the manner of that appointment still riles van Gaal. ""I can imagine Woodward chooses Mourinho,"" said van Gaal. ""He is a top coach. He has won a lot of titles. More than me. ""What I don't like is Woodward contacting my successor, knowing in his mind he will replace me and he keeps his mouth shut for six months. ""Every Friday I had to go into press conferences and be asked what I thought about the rumours. What does that do to the authority of the coach? ""To win the FA Cup when, for six months, the media has a noose round my neck, is my biggest achievement."" Given that van Gaal's extensive honours list includes three Dutch titles and a Champions League with Ajax, the double at Barcelona and coming within one game of completing the treble with Bayern Munich, that is saying something. Defeat in the 2010 Champions League final to Mourinho's Inter Milan cost the Dutchman that day, and the looming shadow of the Portuguese would hang over van Gaal as he made his managerial bow."
notEnglishFootballDocs,"Amid the celebrations that followed the Carabao Cup final penalty shootout victory over Chelsea last month, there was a major concern for Manchester City supporters. Immediately after the game, Pep Guardiola revealed that injuries to the key duo of Aymeric Laporte and Fernandinho would be keeping them out of action ""for weeks"" to come. Laporte had started more Premier League games for City than any other outfield player this season but at least there were obvious replacements. It was the loss of Fernandinho that was seen as potentially decisive in the title race. Up to that point, City had played only two Premier League games all season without the Brazilian - and they had lost them both. As it has turned out, Manchester City have managed to win five in a row without their holding midfielder. Much of the credit for that must go to Ilkay Gundogan for making light of Fernandinho's absence. He has given everyone a reminder of his versatility. Guardiola has always been an admirer. He described Gundogan as ""an incredible player in all senses"" after the win over Watford last time out in the Premier League and it was easy to see why. The German playmaker dominated possession throughout, making 104 passes in the opposition half and creating more chances than any other player on the pitch. Interestingly, the one other midfielder to hit those passing numbers so far this season is Chelsea's Jorginho. He had been a summer target for City prior to his move to Stamford Bridge, but is yet to earn the reviews that Gundogan is now getting in that deep-lying role. Indeed, it might seem curious that Guardiola was ever interested in using Jorginho there instead. Perhaps the clue is that he still doesn't really see that as Gundogan's position. Speaking after a win over Basel last season, he described him as ""a special player with a lot of personality"" but it almost seemed pointed that he referred to Gundogan as an ""attacking midfielder"" - one of three options there alongside David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne. The 28-year-old can play in that advanced position, of course, but the role that he is currently performing in Fernandinho's absence is the one in which he first captured wider attention during his days at Borussia Dortmund. Jurgen Klopp certainly saw him in this deeper role. ""He has the necessary calm, the eye and the vision,"" said the then Dortmund coach at the time. ""Ilkay now sees bigger spaces and can also find them with long balls. He is strong on the ball while knowing when to make a tackle."" Klopp called him a ""complete player"" and it reflects Gundogan's intelligence that he has been able to revert back to this deeper position so easily. His distribution from there has even added a new dimension - as shown by some of his gorgeous passing in the 7-0 win over Schalke. It was his incisive through-ball that set up Sergio Aguero's second goal. There will still be some reservations. Against Swansea, it was noticeable that the opposition midfielders were able to find space in behind him at times, and it's surely inevitable that he will not be able to provide this City side with the same level of protection as Fernandinho. As well as those games against Schalke and Swansea, City have been a little fortunate that their Premier League fixtures have been against West Ham, Bournemouth and Watford. Gundogan's heatmap for these three games shows that despite being deployed as the deepest of the City midfielders, he has still been able to play in similar areas to before. Would Fernandinho's absence prove more telling against, say, Manchester United? That is something for Guardiola to ponder. But Gundogan has helped City through this passage of games and it may be that this run of results will be seen as crucial come May. No wonder the manager would be happier if his problem solver was tied down to a new deal. ""He knows what we want, he knows what we think about him, but it's the same as other cases like we said in the past,"" Guardiola said recently when discussing contract talks that appear to have stalled despite the fact that Gundogan's deal ends in the summer of 2020. ""The final decision is not in our hands. We try to speak with him, we want him to extend the contract right now. Yesterday would have been better than today, and today better than tomorrow. But if he doesn't want to, we cannot do anything else."" Gundogan has been coy so far, stopping short of confirming his intention to extend his stay. He made a point of saying that he is ""not the youngest any more"" by way of an explanation for taking time to ensure that his decision is the right one. ""It may well be that the next one will be my last big contract,"" he said. ""Such a decision must be well considered."" The delay might prove a shrewd one. For while there are more celebrated players at Manchester City, Gundogan has provided a timely reminder of his quality and his versatility. His importance has been put into sharp focus of late. This is a player worth keeping around. Watch Ilkay Gundogan in action for Manchester City against Fulham live on Sky Sports Premier League from 11.30am this Saturday."
notEnglishFootballDocs,"Sweden international Lindelof has been a mainstay at centre-back under Solskjaer, featuring in all but three of the 19 games since the Norwegian took caretaker-charge in December, forming a consistent partnership with Chris Smalling. Solskjaer has lost just once in 13 Premier League games since taking charge, moving United to within three points of third-placed Tottenham, which has seen him become favourite for the job. United, according to reports, could announce the appointment of Solskjaer this week. Asked by Sky Sports about Solskjaer's future, Lindelof said: ""If he gets the job, I will be pleased. ""It's not my job to decide in the end, but, of course, I'm very happy with the things that he has done since he's arrived. I have nothing bad to say about him. ""He's a legend of the club, so he knows everything about being here as a player, so when he speaks to you, you always listen. He knows what he's talking about because he has been through it all. That's also a very good thing to have. ""He's been amazing since he arrived and he came here with a big smile on his face and I think that was important for all of the players. ""He spoke to me and told me to do the things that I'm good at, to show my abilities and to express myself on the pitch. That was very nice to hear."""
notEnglishFootballDocs,"The midfielder is in the final weeks of his contract at Old Trafford and the Spaniard would be free to leave for free if the 29-year-old is unable to reach an agreement over a new deal before the end of the season. Herrera has been pivotal in United's revival since the arrival of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and insists his focus will not be distracted as the club fight for a top-four league finish and success in the Champions League. ""It's logical when you have three months left on your contract and it is the international break,"" Herrera told Spanish publication El Periodico. ""I knew something would come out. I take it with a pinch of salt, I'm focusing on playing football in the remaining month and a half of the season. ""The rest I leave to my agent, both a possible contract renewal with United and talks with another club about my departure."" Herrera, who was the subject of strong interest from Athletic Bilbao - the club he left to join United in June 2014 - in January, says he is intent on continuing to repay the support he has received from the fans ""at the biggest club in England"". ""I'm not going crazy about what is going to happen over the next four months because I don't know if my stay here is over,"" he added. ""I enjoy being at the biggest club in England, the fans love me, they have treated me phenomenally and I owe it to them to listen to what they say, but honestly I don't know what is going to happen. ""All I see is trying to win against Watford next week. If you deserve things and if you are an honest and hardworking person, things happen."""
notEnglishFootballDocs,"Mata was an integral part of Van Gaal's team during his two seasons at the Old Trafford helm, and they won the FA Cup together in 2016. The former Chelsea and Valencia midfielder, whose United contract expires at the end of the season, had nothing but praise for the retiring 67-year-old. Referencing a famous 2-1 away victory at Liverpool, in which the Spaniard scored two brilliant goals, he wrote in his weekly blog:""I wish him the best in the next chapter in his life and I would like to thank him for the time that we spent together [including that game at Anfield]. ""He was an amazing coach, a sensitive and honest person despite looking tough on the outside, a man with principles and a great person. Thank you, Louis, I wish you all the best."" Mata recently returned from a spell out with injury in the FA Cup defeat at Wolves and says he is ready to be part of United's pursuit of a top-four finish, which continues against Watford this weekend. ""In terms of training sessions, this week has been a very positive one for me,"" he said. ""I have made the most of the chance to get in top shape after making my return in the FA Cup not long ago. ""I am feeling good and I am looking forward to doing whatever I can to help the team as much as possible."""
